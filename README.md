# memory-pair-game
This is my holiday version of the popular Memory Card game to train your memory as a part of my homework for <a href='https://github.com/kottans'>Kottans</a> frontend <a href='https://github.com/Kottans/frontend'>course</a>.</br>
I've used my knowledge about event delegation, array methods, toggling background. All game is created with elements, which are being added dynamically. </br>
The rules are simple: find two identical cards with as less steps as possible.</br>
You can change background if you want.</br>
Have fun!</br>
You can play directly from here: https://taniabondarenko.github.io/memory-pair-game/
